Feature: A.2.3.0200. Assign administrators and account managers

  As a REDCap end user
  I want to see that Assign Super Users / Account Managers is functioning as expected

  Scenario: A.2.3.0200.100 Give/remove user admin user rights
    ##REDUNDANT_TEST This test is also testing for A.2.3.0100.100 View administrator accounts
    Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_Admin"
    When I click on the link labeled "Control Center"
    And I click on the link labeled "Administrator Privileges"
    Then I should see "Set administrator privileges"
    And I should see a table header and rows containing the following values in the administrators table:
      | Administrators          |
      | Test_Admin (Admin User) |

    ##TEST Add administrator account no privileges
    Given I enter "Test_User1" into the field with the placeholder text of "Search users to add as admin"
    # The following line is intentionally duplicated to produce the desired behavior per Adam's suggestion on https://github.com/vanderbilt-redcap/redcap_rsvc/pull/17
    And I click on the button labeled "Add"
    And I click on the button labeled "Add"
    Then I should see a dialog containing the following text: "check one or more"
    And I click on the button labeled "Close" in the dialog box

    Given I clear field and enter "Test_User1" into the field with the placeholder text of "Search users to add as admin"
    And I enable the Administrator Privilege "Set administrator privileges" for a new administrator
    And I click on the button labeled "Add"
    Then I should see 'The user "Test_User1" has now been granted one or more administrator privileges'

    Given  I click on the button labeled "OK"
    Then I should see a table header and rows containing the following values in the administrators table:
      | Administrators | Set administrator privileges | Access to all projects and data with maximum user privileges | Manage user accounts | Modify system configuration pages | Install, upgrade, and configure External Modules | Perform REDCap upgrades | Access to Control Center dashboards |
      | Test_User1     | [✓]                          | [ ]                                                          | [ ]                  | [ ]                               | [ ]                                              | [ ]                     | [ ]                                 |
