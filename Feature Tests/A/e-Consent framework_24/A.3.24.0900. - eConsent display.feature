Feature: Control Center: The system shall support the option to display or hide the 'e-Consent Framework' for all surveys.

       As a REDCap end user
       I want to see that eConsent is functioning as expected

              #SETUP
              Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_Admin"
              #Manual: Append project name with the current version (i.e. "X.X.X.XXX.XXX - LTS X.X.X")
              And I create a new project named "A.3.24.0900.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project_1.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button
              And I click on the link labeled "Designer"
              #Verify econsent framework enabled
