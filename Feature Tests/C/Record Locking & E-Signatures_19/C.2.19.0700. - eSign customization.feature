    Scenario: C.2.19.700.100 Customize Record Locking display and text
        #SETUP
        Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_Admin"
        #Manual: Append project name with the current version (i.e. "X.X.X.XXX.XXX - LTS X.X.X")
        And I create a new project named "C.2.19.700.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project_1.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button
