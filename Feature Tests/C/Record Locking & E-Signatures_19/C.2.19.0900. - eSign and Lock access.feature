Feature: User Interface: The system shall support the ability to limit access to the Record Locking Customization module, locking/unlocking instruments, locking/unlocking with e-signature authority and LOCK/INLOCK *Entire* Records (record level) through user rights.

    As a REDCap end user
    I want to see that Record locking and E-signatures is functioning as expected

    Scenario: C.2.19.900.100 Enable user rights for Record Locking Customization module
        Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_Admin"
        And I create a new project named "C.2.19.900.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project_1.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button

    Scenario: ##SETUP_PRODUCTION
        When I click on the link labeled "Project Setup"
        And I click on the button labeled "Move project to production"
        And I click on the radio labeled "Keep ALL data saved so far" in the dialog box
        And I click on the button labeled "YES, Move to Production Status" in the dialog box
        Then I should see Project status: "Production"

    Scenario: #SETUP
        When I click on the link labeled "Customize & Manage Locking/E-signatures"
        And I click on the button labeled "I understand. Let me make changes" in the dialog box
        And for the Column Name "Also display E-signature option on instrument?", I check the checkbox within the Record Locking Customization table for the Data Collection Instrument named "Text Validation"
        Then I should see a table header and rows containing the following values in a table:
            | Display the Lock option for this instrument? | Data Collection Instrument | Also display E-signature option on instrument? | Lock Record Custom Text |
            | [✓]                                          | Text Validation            | [✓]                                            | [text box]              |
