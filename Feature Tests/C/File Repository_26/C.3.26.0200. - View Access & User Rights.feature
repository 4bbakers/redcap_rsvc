Feature: User Interface: The system shall support limiting file repository user view access and export rights.

    As a REDCap end user
    I want to see that file repository is functioning as expected

    Scenario: C.3.26.200.100 - Limit user view and export access based on User Rights and DAG

    #SETUP
        Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_Admin"
        When I create a new project named "C.3.26.200.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project_1.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button
        And I click on the link labeled "My Projects"
        And I click on the link labeled "C.3.26.200.100"

    ##SETUP auto-archive
        When I click on the link labeled "Designer"
        And I click on the button labeled "e-Consent"
        And I enable the toggle button labeled "Consent"
        And I should see a toggle button labeled "Consent" that is in the enabled state

    ##SETUP File Repository
        And I click on the link labeled "File Repository"

    #Create DAG limited folder
        And I click on the button labeled "Create folder"
        And I enter "TestGroup1_Folder" into the input field labeled "New folder name:"
        And I select "TestGroup1" on the dropdown field labeled "Limit access by Data Access Group?"
        And I click on the button labeled "Create folder" in the dialog box
        Then I should see "TestGroup1_Folder"

    #Create role limited folder
        And I click on the button labeled "Create folder"
        And I enter "Role1_Folder" into the input field labeled "New folder name"
        And I select "1_FullRights" on the dropdown field labeled "Limit access by User Role?"
        And I click on the button labeled "Create folder" in the dialog box
        Then I should see "Role1_Folder"

  #Scenario: SETUP User Rights
    ##SETUP User Rights:
        When I click on the link labeled "User Rights"
        And I click on the button labeled "Upload or download users, roles, and assignments"
        And I click on the link labeled "Upload users (CSV)"
        Then I upload a "csv" format file located at "/import_files/user list for project 1.csv", by clicking the button near "Select your CSV file of users and their user rights to be added/modified:" to browse for the file, and clicking the button labeled "Upload" to upload the file
        Then I should see a dialog containing the following text: "Upload users (CSV) - Confirm"
        And I should see a table header and rows containing the following values in a table in the dialog box:
            | username   |

            | test_user4 |

        Given I click on the button labeled "Upload" in the dialog box
        Then I should see a dialog containing the following text: "SUCCESS!"
        And I click on the button labeled "Close" in the dialog box

        Then I should see a table header and rows containing the following values in a table:
            | Role name               | Username            |
