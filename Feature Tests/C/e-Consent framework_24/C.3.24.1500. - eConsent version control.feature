    Then I should see a table header and rows containing the following values in a table:
      | Name | PDF utilized e-Consent Framework | Record | Survey Completed                             | Identifier (Name, DOB)        | Version | Type                  |
      | .pdf | YES                              |      3 | Participant Consent (Event 1 (Arm 1: Arm 1)) | FirstName LatName, 2000-01-01 |         | e-Consent Participant |
      | .pdf | YES                              |      2 | Participant Consent (Event 1 (Arm 1: Arm 1)) | FirstName LatName, 2000-01-01 |         | e-Consent Participant |
      | .pdf | YES                              |      1 | Participant Consent (Event 1 (Arm 1: Arm 1)) | FirstName LatName, 2000-01-01 |         | e-Consent Participant |

  Scenario:
    When I click on the file link for record "3" Survey "(Event 1 (Arm 1: Arm 1))"
    Then I should NOT see "consent.pdf"
