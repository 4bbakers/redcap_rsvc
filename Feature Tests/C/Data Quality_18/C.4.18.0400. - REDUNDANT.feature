    As a REDCap end user
    I want to see that Data Quality Module is functioning as expected

    Scenario: C.4.18.0400.100
#     #This feature test is REDUNDANT and can be viewed in C.4.18.0300.100 & C.4.18.0500.

#     Scenario: C.4.18.0100.100 Default data quality rules
#         #SETUP
#         Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_Admin"
#         And I create a new project named "C.4.18.0100.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project418.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button
