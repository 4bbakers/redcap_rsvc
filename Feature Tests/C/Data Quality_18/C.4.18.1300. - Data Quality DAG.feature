Feature: User Interface: The system shall support limiting rule viewing to a Data Access Group.

    As a REDCap end user
    I want to see that Data Quality Module is functioning as expected

    Scenario: C.4.18.1300.100 DAG limits rule viewing
        #SETUP
        Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_Admin"
        And I create a new project named "C.4.18.1300.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project418.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button

        #SETUP_PRODUCTION
        When I click on the link labeled "Project Setup"
        And I click on the button labeled "Move project to production"
        And I click on the radio labeled "Keep ALL data saved so far" in the dialog box
        And I click on the button labeled "YES, Move to Production Status" in the dialog box
        Then I should see Project status: "Production"

        #USER_RIGHTS
        When I click on the link labeled "User Rights"
        And I enter "Test_User1" into the field with the placeholder text of "Assign new user to role"
        And I click on the button labeled "Assign to role"
        And I select "1_FullRights" on the dropdown field labeled "Select Role" on the role selector dropdown
        And I select "TestGroup1" on the dropdown field labeled "[No Assignment]" on the role selector dropdown
        And I click on the button labeled exactly "Assign" on the role selector dropdown
        Then I should see "Test User1" within the "1_FullRights" row of the column labeled "Username" of the User Rights table

        Then I should see a table header and rows containing the following values in a table:
            | Role         | Username or users assigned to a role | Expiration | Data Access Group |
            | —            | test_admin (Admin User)              | never      | —                 |
            | 1_FullRights | test_user1 (Test User1)              | never      | TestGroup1        |


        When I enter "Test_User2" into the field with the placeholder text of "Assign new user to role"
        And I click on the button labeled "Assign to role"
        And I select "1_FullRights" on the dropdown field labeled "Select Role" on the role selector dropdown
        And I select "TestGroup2" on the dropdown field labeled "[No Assignment]" on the role selector dropdown
        And I click on the button labeled exactly "Assign" on the role selector dropdown
        Then I should see "Test User2" within the "1_FullRights" row of the column labeled "Username" of the User Rights table
        Then I should see a table header and rows containing the following values in a table:
            | Role         | Username or users assigned to a role | Expiration | Data Access Group |
            | —            | test_admin (Admin User)              | never      | —                 |
            | 1_FullRights | test_user1 (Test User1)              | never      | TestGroup1        |
            |              | test_user2 (Test User2)              | never      | TestGroup2        |

        #SETUP: Create Data Quality Rule
        When I click on the link labeled "Data Quality"
        And I enter "TestGroup1" into the textarea field labeled "Enter descriptive name for new rule"
        And I click on "" in the textarea field labeled "Enter logic for new rule"
        And I wait for 1 minute
        And I clear field and enter "([ptname]<>[name]) AND ([user-dag-name]='testgroup1')" in the textarea field labeled "Logic Editor" in the dialog box
        And I click on the button labeled "Update & Close Editor" in the dialog box
        And I click on the button labeled "Add"
        Then I should see a table header and rows containing the following values in a table:
            | Rule # | Rule Name  | Rule Logic (Show discrepancy only if...)              |
            | 3      | TestGroup1 | ([ptname]<>[name]) AND ([user-dag-name]="testgroup1") |
        And I logout

        #FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENT
        ##ACTION: testuser1 can see results within DAG
        Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_User1"
        When I click on the link labeled "My Projects"
        And I click on the link labeled "C.4.18.1300.100"
        And I click on the link labeled "Data Quality"
        Then I should see "Data Quality Rules"

        When I click on the button labeled "All"
        ##VERIFY
        Then I should see a table header and rows containing the following values in a table:
            | Rule # | Rule Name  | Rule Logic (Show discrepancy only if...)              | Total Discrepancies |
            | 3      | TestGroup1 | ([ptname]<>[name]) AND ([user-dag-name]="testgroup1") | 2                   |
        And I logout

        #FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENT
        ##ACTION: testuser2 cannot see results within DAG
        Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_User2"
        When I click on the link labeled "My Projects"
        And I click on the link labeled "C.4.18.1300.100"
        And I click on the link labeled "Data Quality"
        Then I should see "Data Quality Rules"

        When I click on the button labeled "All"
        ##VERIFY
        Then I should see a table header and rows containing the following values in a table:
            | Rule # | Rule Name  | Rule Logic (Show discrepancy only if...)              | Total Discrepancies |
            | 3      | TestGroup1 | ([ptname]<>[name]) AND ([user-dag-name]="testgroup1") | 0                   |
