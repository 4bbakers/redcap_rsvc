Feature: User Interface: The system shall support editing of user defined rules.

    As a REDCap end user
    I want to see that Data Quality Module is functioning as expected

    Scenario: C.4.18.0700.100 Edit rule
        #ATS prerequisite: Normal users cannot move projects to production by default - let's adjust that before we proceed.
        Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_Admin"
        When I click on the link labeled "Control Center"
        And I click on the link labeled "User Settings"
        Then I should see "System-level User Settings"
        Given I select "Yes, normal users can move projects to production" on the dropdown field labeled "Allow normal users to move projects to production?"
        When I click on the button labeled "Save Changes"
        And I see "Your system configuration values have now been changed!"
        Then I logout

        #SETUP
        Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_User1"
        And I create a new project named "C.4.18.0700.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project418.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button

        #SETUP_PRODUCTION
        When I click on the link labeled "Project Setup"
        And I click on the button labeled "Move project to production"
        And I click on the radio labeled "Keep ALL data saved so far" in the dialog box
        And I click on the button labeled "YES, Move to Production Status" in the dialog box
        Then I should see Project status:  "Production"
        #USER_RIGHTS
        When I click on the link labeled "User Rights"
        And I click on the link labeled "test_user1"
        And I click on the button labeled "Edit user privileges"
        Then I should see 'Editing existing user "test_user1"'
        Then  I check the User Right named "Data Quality - Create & edit rules"
        Then  I check the User Right named "Data Quality - Execute rules"
        And I click on the button labeled "Save Changes"
        Then I should see 'User "test_user1" was successfully edited'

        #FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENT
        ##ACTION: Manual rule add
        When I click on the link labeled "Data Quality"
        Then I should see "Data Quality Rules"

        When I enter "Integer" into the textarea field labeled "Enter descriptive name for new rule"
        And I click on "" in the textarea field labeled "Enter logic for new rule"
        And I wait for 1 minute
        And I clear field and enter "[integer]='1'" in the textarea field labeled "Logic Editor" in the dialog box
        And I click on the button labeled "Update & Close Editor" in the dialog box
        And I click on the button labeled "Add"
        ##VERIFY
        Then I should see a table header and rows containing the following values in a table:
            | Rule # | Rule Name | Rule Logic (Show discrepancy only if...) |
            | 3      | Integer   | [integer]='1'                            |
