Feature: User Interface: General: The system shall support the ability to erase all data for a project at once only in development.

  As a REDCap end user
  I want to see that Project Setup is functioning as expected

  Scenario: B.6.4.1100.100 Erase all data only in development as User
    ##ATS prerequisite: Normal users cannot move projects to production by default - let's adjust that before we proceed.
    Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_Admin"
    When I click on the link labeled "Control Center"
    And I click on the link labeled "User Settings"
    Then I should see "System-level User Settings"
    Given I select "Yes, normal users can move projects to production" on the dropdown field labeled "Allow normal users to move projects to production?"
    When I click on the button labeled "Save Changes"
    And I see "Your system configuration values have now been changed!"
    Then I logout

    Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_User1"
    And I create a new project named "B.6.4.1100.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project_1.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button

    ##ACTION Verify record exist ##VERIFY_RSD
    When I click on the link labeled "Record Status Dashboard"
    Then I should see a table header and rows containing the following values in the record status dashboard table:
