    As a REDCap end user
    I want to see that Draft Mode is functioning as expected

    Scenario: B.4.20.0900.100 Data dictionary version history
        #ATS prerequisite: Normal users cannot move projects to production by default - let's adjust that before we proceed.

        When I click on the link labeled "Control Center"
        And I click on the link labeled "User Settings"
        Then I should see "System-level User Settings"
