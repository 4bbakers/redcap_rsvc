Feature: B.3.14.1000. The system shall allow users to delete all data on the current form of a given record from the Record Home Page. 

  As a REDCap end user
  I want to see that delete record is functioning as expected

  Scenario: B.3.14.1000.100 Delete all data in a form for a record form
    ###ATS prerequisite: Normal users cannot move projects to production by default - let's adjust that before we proceed.
    Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_Admin"
    When I click on the link labeled "Control Center"
    And I click on the link labeled "User Settings"
    Then I should see "System-level User Settings"
    Given I select "Yes, normal users can move projects to production" on the dropdown field labeled "Allow normal users to move projects to production?"
    When I click on the button labeled "Save Changes"
    And I see "Your system configuration values have now been changed!"
    Then I logout

    #SETUP
    Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_User1"
    And I create a new project named "B.3.14.1000.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project_3.14.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button

    #SETUP_PRODUCTION

    Then I should see Project status: "Production"

    #SET UP_USER_RIGHTS
    When I click on the link labeled "User Rights"
    And I enter "Test_User1" into the field with the placeholder text of "Assign new user to role"
    And I click on the button labeled "Assign to role"
    And I select "1_FullRights" on the dropdown field labeled "Select Role" on the role selector dropdown
    When I click on the button labeled exactly "Assign" on the role selector dropdown
    Then I should see "Test User1" within the "1_FullRights" row of the column labeled "Username" of the User Rights table

    ##ACTION
    When I click on the link labeled "Record Status Dashboard"
    And I locate the bubble for the "Text Validation" instrument on event "Event 1" for record ID "2" and click on the bubble
    Then I should see "Name" in the data entry form field "Name"
    And I should see "email@test.edu" in the data entry form field "Email"
    And I should see a button labeled "Delete data for THIS FORM only"

    Then I should see a table header and rows containing the following values in the logging table:
      | Username   | Action          | List of Data Changes OR Fields Exported |
      | test_user1 | Update record 2 | email = ''                              |
