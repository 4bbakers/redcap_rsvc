    As a REDCap end user

        When I click on the link labeled "Control Center"
        And I click on the link labeled "User Settings"
        Then I should see "System-level User Settings"

        When I click on the button labeled "Save Changes"
        And I see "Your system configuration values have now been changed!"
        Then I logout
