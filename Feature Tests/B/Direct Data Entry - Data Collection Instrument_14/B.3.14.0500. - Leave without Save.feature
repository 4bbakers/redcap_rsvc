Feature: Saving Data: The system shall support the prompt to save when a user attempts to navigate away from a data entry page without saving: (Save changes and leave | Leave without saving changes | Stay on page)

    As a REDCap end user
    I want to see that leave without saving data entry page navigation is functioning as expected

    Scenario: B.3.14.500.100 Navigate away from a data entry page options
        ##ATS prerequisite: Normal users cannot move projects to production by default - let's adjust that before we proceed.
