    Scenario: #SETUP
        Given I login to REDCap with the user "Test_Admin"
        And I create a new project named " B.3.14.1400.100" by clicking on "New Project" in the menu bar, selecting "Practice / Just for fun" from the dropdown, choosing file "Project_3.14.xml", and clicking the "Create Project" button
